## Project Goals

This is **NOT** a complex game project. This is:

- **Platform exploration**: Learning Yandex.Games integration
- **TDD practice**: Test-Driven Development for game logic
- **CI/CD experiment**: Automated testing and deployment pipeline

**Complexity is in engineering, not in game design.**
